## 📌 Project Overview

This project features a complete **Airline Reservation and Operations Database** built in **PostgreSQL**. It demonstrates advanced relational database modeling techniques with a highly normalized schema (11+ tables) and includes a suite of analytical SQL queries to simulate real-world business intelligence scenarios.

The system is designed to handle core airline operations, including flight scheduling, ticket booking, passenger management, and aircraft assignments.

## 🚀 Features

* **Normalized Schema**: A robust database structure comprising **11+ interrelated tables** designed to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity (3NF/BCNF).
* **Realistic Seed Data**: Includes a `seed_data.sql` script that populates the database with realistic sample data (passengers, flights, airports, etc.) for testing and demonstration.
* **Analytical Queries**: A collection of complex SQL queries (`queries.sql`) that answer critical business questions, such as:
    * Revenue analysis per flight or route.
    * Passenger demographics and booking trends.
    * Flight utilization and load factors.
    * Operational reporting (delays, cancellations).

## 📂 Repository Structure

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `schema.sql` | Contains the DDL (Data Definition Language) commands to create tables, views, indexes, and define relationships (foreign keys). |
| `seed_data.sql` | Contains the DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands to insert sample data into the tables. |
| `queries.sql` | A collection of SQL queries demonstrating data analysis, joins, aggregations, and reporting capabilities. |
| `README.md` | Project documentation. |

## 🛠️ Database Schema

The database models the following key entities:

* **Airports**: Airport codes, names, cities, and locations.
* **Aircrafts**: Fleet information including models, capacity, and range.
* **Flights**: Scheduled flights with departure/arrival times and status.
* **Passengers**: Customer details and frequent flyer information.
* **Bookings/Tickets**: Reservation records linking passengers to flights.
* **Seats**: Seat assignments and class (Economy, Business, First).
* *Note: Refer to `schema.sql` for the exact table definitions and relationships.*

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

* **PostgreSQL** (v12 or higher recommended)
* A SQL client (e.g., **pgAdmin**, **DBeaver**, or command line `psql`)

## 📥 Installation & Usage

Follow these steps to set up the database locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AbhinavRudra/airline-reservation-postgresql.git](https://github.com/AbhinavRudra/airline-reservation-postgresql.git)
    cd airline-reservation-postgresql
    ```

2.  **Create the Database**
    Open your terminal or SQL client and create a new database:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE airline_db;
    ```

3.  **Run the Schema Script**
    Connect to your new database and execute the schema file to create the tables:
    ```bash
    psql -U your_username -d airline_db -f schema.sql
    ```

4.  **Load Sample Data**
    Populate the tables with the provided seed data:
    ```bash
    psql -U your_username -d airline_db -f seed_data.sql
    ```

5.  **Execute Analysis Queries**
    Run the analytical queries to explore the data:
    ```bash
    psql -U your_username -d airline_db -f queries.sql
    ```

## 📊 Example Analysis

The `queries.sql` file includes SQL scripts for scenarios such as:
* *Retrieving all flights scheduled for a specific date.*
* *Calculating the total revenue generated by a specific aircraft.*
* *Identifying the most popular flight routes.*
* *Listing passengers with multiple bookings.*
